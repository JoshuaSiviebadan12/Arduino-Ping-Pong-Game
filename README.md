# Arduino-Ping-Pong-Game
This project is a arudino ping pong game that is used to play ping pong against a CPU. You play as the green paddle and the CPU is the red paddle, the first to 8 goals wins the game. This project uses an arduino uno, a oled display, breadboard, jumper wires and push buttons. The power supply of the oled is coming from the arduino uno, which is powering the oled with 3.3v. The oled screen is used to display the game and the score, it also has its own custom menu. To get all of these displays onto the oled screen, they were programmed through the arduino software onto the arduino uno. The push buttons are used to start the game(which is done by clicking any button while on the menu screen)and to move your paddle, the left push button moves the paddle down and the right push button moves the paddle up.
